**PassportUK Pro** is a high-precision, industrial-grade AI solution engineered for the automated generation of government-compliant identity documentation. Built on the **Anatomical Fulfillment Engine (AFE)**, the platform eliminates the high rejection rates associated with amateur photography through deep biometric analysis and generative reconstruction.

## 🏛️ Strategic Core Pillars

### 1. Precision Alignment
Utilizes volumetric facial seed detection to ensure the crown-to-chin ratio strictly occupies **70-80%** of the vertical 35mm x 45mm frame, meeting international ICAO and HMPO requirements.

### 2. Biometric Privacy (Transient Pipeline)
Engineered with a "Zero-Retention" architecture. Biometric data is processed in a transient memory state and purged immediately upon session termination, ensuring full alignment with **GDPR** and **UK Data Protection Act** standards.

### 3. Anatomical Reconstruction
Beyond simple filters, the engine performs "Demographic-Aware Anatomical Fulfillment," synthesizing professional attire (suits, cardigans, or plain infant-wear) and correcting posture to create a dignified, compliant portrait from any source image.
