- **PASS/REJECT LOGIC**: DOWNLOADS ARE LOCKED FOR IMAGES SCORING UNDER 90% TO ENSURE TOTAL COMPLIANCE.
- **METRIC BREAKDOWN**: AUDITS LIGHTING, BACKGROUND, EXPRESSION, AND DIMENSIONS SEPARATELY.

### 2. FORCED UK DIMENSIONAL ALIGNMENT
VERSION 3.5 INTRODUCES STRICT CROWN-TO-CHIN FORCING:
- **29MM-34MM RULE**: AUTOMATICALLY SCALES THE HEAD TO OCCUPY THE LEGAL 70-80% VERTICAL WINDOW.
- **ASPECT RATIO FORCING**: GUARANTEES A PERFECT 35:45 (7:9) RATIO ON EXPORT.

### 3. SURGICAL FACIAL AUDIT & REPAIR
- **SPECULAR SPOT LIQUIDATION**: ELIMINATES GLARE AND WHITE SPOTS ON THE SKIN SURFACE.
